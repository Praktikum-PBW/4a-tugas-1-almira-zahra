    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        <b>A</b>nimals have been used in biomedical research for many years. The usage of animals in a biomedical study is considered an important experimental subject because of their physiological similarity to human beings. For establishing the safety and efficacy of drugs, experimentation on animals is usually unavoidable. Sometimes animals suffer injury, pain or suffering, and even death. In India, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, was introduced to prevent unnecessary pain or suffering from being inflicted on animals (Rupali Mukherjee, 2014). As drugs are an essential commodity, for safety studies, animals are wildly used in preclinical studies for many serious diseases. Drugs, even cosmetic preparations are tested on animals for many years. Cosmetics are considered to be luxury products; they are not part of the essential commodity. Testing cosmetic ingredients on animals is primarily to check whether the product is safe and hypoallergenic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cosmetic preparations contain many chemicals, so companies need to test these chemicals for the determination of toxicity, dosing, and efficacy. To make cosmetic products safe to protect public health, it becomes mandatory for companies to perform these tests. Skin irritation, contact urticarial, stinging, allergic sensitization, phototoxicity and photoallergy are some of the adverse effects that may be caused due to cosmetic preparations. Various methods have been described to predict the potential of substances to induce irritation or sensitization. For detection of potential primary irritation, a Draize test is performed where albino rabbits are clipped and the substance to be tested is applied. Some of the widely used tests for cosmetic products are testing of hair and bath preparations for eye irritation properties, test on the eye mucosa of the albino rabbit. Repeated insult test for potential skin irritant through the skin, in case of unknown chemicals, some tests like provocative patch test are performed on animals like guinea pigs or rabbits.

        Over recent years, there is increased concern for animals, among animal welfare organizations, researchers, environmental activists, animal lovers, and even among the common public. To protect animals from unnecessary pain and injuries many countries have passed legislation to ban the use of animals for testing cosmetic products. The present study seeks to examinea few countries that have initiated, attempted to ban cosmetic testing on animals.

    <h2 id="dua">Cruel Experiment</h2>
    <p>
        The suffering inflicted on animals in laboratories is truly disturbing. Experiments recently uncovered by Animal Aid (and supported by UK medical research charities) have involved:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Monkeys are brain-damaged with a toxic chemical and given the street drug ecstasy (victimsofcharity.org, 2014).</li>
        <li>Pregnant sheep and their unborn lambs are surgically mutilated, partially suffocated, and killed (victimsofcharity.org, 2015). </li>
        <li>Rats and mice being are poisoned with an industrial chemical for around six months to induce cancer (victimsofcharity.org, 2014).</li>
        <li>Genetically modified mice are bred to suffer limb paralysis, anxiety, and motor dysfunction, then suspended by their tails to assess abnormal behavior (victimsofcharity.org, 2014).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Proponents of vivisection would no doubt claim that these are extreme examples, handpicked to support our case. But the European directive that governs animal experiments, in Britain and other member states, makes it clear that distressing suffering is an accepted part of the experimental program. The legislation divides experiments into three categories of 'severity' and provides examples for each.
    </p>
    <p>
        Experiments that fall into the benign-sounding 'mild' category include force-feeding animals substances and restraining them in 'metabolic cages', where they are deprived of social contact. Examples of 'moderate' experiments include removing part of the animal's skull to expose their brain and giving them a dose of irradiation. Research that falls into the 'severe' category includes subjecting animals to inescapable electric shocks and deliberately injuring them to produce multiple organ failures. These are not isolated, cherry-picked experiments, however the research that EU legislators considered commonplace enough to include as examples.

    <p>
        Due to growing concern over the use of animals in cosmetic testing, many countries have taken initiative, prepared plans to either completely ban or limit and regulate animal testing in respective countries. Few countries have implemented the ban process such as India, Guatemala, Norway, and Colombia.
    </p>
    <p>
        India banned cosmetic testing on animals in 2014 (Rupali Mukherjee, 2014). The new rule has been added to existing drug and cosmetic rules, 1945 by the ministry of health and family welfare. As per the new rule, it is prohibited to test cosmetics on animals and no person shall use any animal for testing cosmetic preparations. India has now also implemented a ban on importing such products that test on animals.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2015, Guatemala also banned cosmetic animal testing (understanding animal research, 2021). As a country, Guatemala, increasingly stepping up and ending cosmetic animal testing. The only way to confirm no animal suffers from cosmetics is a global ban that ends cruel testing everywhere. In 2013 in Norway, selling cosmetics tested on animals within the European Union (EU)-including Norway-is prohibited (Julie Ryland, 2019). Strict rules have been in place over the past decade to control and how animal testing is being used in cosmetics production. The EU has further tightened the rules and prohibited all imports and sales of cosmetics tested on animals in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Colombia has banned animal testing on cosmetic products, ingredients, and combinations. This Law will be in full force in August 2024 (Brigard Urrutia). Said prohibition includes importing, manufacturing, and commercializing cosmetic products that entail animal testing. The prohibition will not apply if there is no alternative model for animal testing or the data obtained by animal testing has a purpose different than cosmetics.
